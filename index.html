        Ill always be here for you. Everything moves quickly. Time never stands still, and I know how fleeting every second is. As I go through my life, 
        it's you I want to tell about the best moments and the worst. Sharing everything with you makes it all better. You bring me comfort in the hard things 
        and increase my joy when everything is great. I want to thank you because you have always been around when I need your presence. Some day, when the end of my life comes, 
        I will know it was well spent because I got to spend some of it with you. I am always blessed to have you as my bestfriend.</span><br><span>Iloveyou always my Princes<span
